# CMP105 2023-4 

Forbidden Rhythms. 
by William Kavanagh.

A simple rhythm-movement game with a Chrome-dino-inspired intercedent level.

Note: This is not polished, or bug-free. But it (mostly) works. There are thousands of ways in which it can be improved/extended/expanded/remade/rebuilt.

This is an optional project to be extended by CMP105 students for the individual submission starting in week 9.

Forbidden Rhythms: Turntable Terror

A simple rhythm game with disorienting features to keep you on your toes

Changelist:

New Runner Move:
The runner level now features a ground-pound move, complete with wide boxes for you to stomp, a subtle squash & stretch animation, and a thud sound upon landing.

Screen Rotation:
The wizard level also rotates the stage whenever the controls are jumbled. This rotation is accompanied by an oblique perspective and a whoosh sound on rotation.

The Meteor:
A new hazard has been added to the wizard level. The meteor will chase you down with the power of pathfinding, and it has a firey tail that you don't want to run into.
